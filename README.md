- **Day 1**
  - **Part 1**: Straightforward
  - **Part 2**: First I tried to replace each "word number" with the number itself, but this led to misidentifying the last digit of the string. For example "oneight" became "1ight", with 1 being the last digit instead of 8. Had to bash my head into the wall for a bit to solve.
  
- **Day 2**
  - **Part 1**: Straightforward
  - **Part 2**: Also straightforward, easier than day 1 imo
 
- **Day 3**
  - **Part 1**: I didn't mind my solution for this. I used a set.
  - **Part 2**: I did mind my solution for this. Definitely gross.
