# advent-of-code-2023

- **Day 1**
  - **Part 1**: Straightforward.
  - **Part 2**: First I tried to replace each "word number" with the number itself, but this led to misidentifying the last digit of the string. For example "oneight" became "1ight", with 1 being the last digit instead of 8. Had to bash my head into the wall for a bit to solve.
  
- **Day 2**
  - **Part 1**: Straightforward.
  - **Part 2**: Also straightforward, easier than day 1 imo
 
- **Day 3**
  - **Part 1**: I didn't mind my solution for this. I used a set.
  - **Part 2**: I did mind my solution for this. Definitely gross.

- **Day 4**
  - **Part 1**: Straightforward enough.
  - **Part 2**: I misread the question and got stuck in an infinite cycle. 

- **Day 5**
  - **Part 1**: I recognised that I'd have to avoid hashmaps which was good.
  - **Part 2**: Still don't know the proper solution for this so I just ran my code in release mode and let it cook for 30 seconds.

- **Day 6**
  - **Part 1**: So straightforward it worked first try.
  - **Part 2**: First try again I am the goat.

- **Day 7**
  - **Part 1**: My favourite puzzle so far, I enjoyed calculating the hand type from the cards. I forgot that aces are better than kings which slowed me down a bit.
  - **Part 2**: Brute force all joker permutations with cartesian product to see if they produce a higher hand type than the current. I'm too silly to figure out the proper solution if there is one. Cartesian product in real life though.

- **Day 8**
  - **Part 1**: Straightforward.
  - **Part 2**: I didn't recognise that I had to use LCM so I brute forced it for an hour before looking up the solution.

- **Day 9**
  - **Part 1**: Straightforward enough although I think the test cases they gave were a little narrow i.e. didn't include negatives.
  - **Part 2**: Very simple solution of just reversing the input string, idk why they did this.

- **Day 10**

- **Day 11**
  - **Part 1**: I solved it by actually expanding the galaxy to contain new rows and cols, then after solving part 2 I went back and made it use part 2.
  - **Part 2**: Got stuck for a bit cause I was adding one too many rows to the total distance. I liked this day.
